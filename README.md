# PentestAssistant

LLM-based Web automatic penetration detector with function call techniques and multi-agent architectures.


## Introduction

ðŸ¤– PentestAssistant utilizes three main agents (planner, executor, and refiner agents) to perform the workflow of automatic penetration detection. Moreover, it can invoke several penetration detection tools, such as nmap and sqlmap, according to user requests.

## Quick Start

First clone the repository source code

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/HUSTInfSecLabs/PentestAssistant.git
```

We recommend using conda to create a python virtual environment and using python 3.10

```shell
$ cd botend
$ conda create -n PentestAssistant python=3.10
$ python --version
Python 3.10.13
```

Install all dependencies in the virtual environment
```shell
$ conda activate PentestAssistant
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

For LLM, we support some popular and commercial LLM, such as ChatGPT, deepseek, and Qwen, we should select one and add the api key to the [configuration](config/config.ini).

In this project, we use a reranker model to sort all api list to help LLM reduct the selection range, so we should download this reranker model: [bge-reranker-large](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-large) and modify the [configuration](config/config.ini).

Moreover, we need to install the following penetration testing tools for PenetestAssistant to call: Nmap, Sqlmap, Tqlmap, Xsstrike, Dirsearch, Dnsenum, Hydra, and Dirsearch. For Xsstrike, Tplmap, Dirsearch, and CMSeek, we have included them in our source code, so we do not need to install them again.

Now, we can use PentestAssistant.

```shell
$ python app.py
```
